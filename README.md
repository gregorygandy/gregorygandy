# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile. You should also check out my blog at [gregorygandy.com](https://www.gregorygandy.com). My general interests include system and software configuration management, lightweight web development, and statistical computing. Here are some of my projects organized by category:

## System configuration

I like using different operating systems; I dual-boot Windows and Fedora Workstation on a Framework Laptop 13, access a Mac Mini desktop remotely, and use OPNsense (FreeBSD) for a home router.

- [Mac Ansible playbook](https://github.com/gregorygandy/mac-playbook)
- [OPNsense Ansible playbook](https://github.com/gregorygandy/opnsense-playbook)
- [NixOS config](https://github.com/gregorygandy/nixos-config)
- [dotfiles](https://github.com/gregorygandy/dotfiles)

## Web development

- [Ultralight Food](https://ultralightfood.com) is a catalog of backpacking foods that makes it easy for backpackers to find foods that meet their specific nutritional, dietary, and trip requirements. Metrics relevant to backpacking's unique requirements, such as calorie-to-weight and calorie-to-volume, are calculated and filterable.

## Statistical computing
