# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile. You should also check out my blog at [gregorygandy.com](https://www.gregorygandy.com). My general interests include system and software configuration management, lightweight web development, and statistical computing. Here are some of my projects organized by category:

## System configuration

I like using different operating systems; I dual-boot Windows and Fedora Workstation on my Framework Laptop 13, access my M1 Mac Mini remotely using Chrome Remote Desktop, and use OPNsense (FreeBSD) for my home router.
